    "# 0. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds a unified understanding of how Rectified Flow (RF) dynamics can be solved efficiently using the Unified Predictor–Corrector (UniPC) framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by formulating rectified flow as a simple, deterministic motion in log-SNR space, where data points evolve along straight lines between pure noise and clean signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then derive UniPC from first principles as a general solver for linear inhomogeneous ODEs, introducing its Green’s-function foundation and numerical discretization rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we apply UniPC to the rectified flow equation, showing how the continuous formulation reduces naturally to practical discrete updates, from the zeroth-order explicit Euler form to higher-order predictor–corrector variants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these sections provide both intuition and mathematical structure for how rectified flow models are integrated in practice, bridging physical dynamics, neural prediction, and numerical ODE solvers under a single unified lens.\n",
